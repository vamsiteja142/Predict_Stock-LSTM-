Use the price history AND two other metrics of your choice to predict the price of GOOGL stock with an LSTM network. You can find the CSV here. Metrics could be sentiment analysis from Twitter of what people have said about Google, dividends, etc.

##Credits

Credits go to jaungiers. I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
